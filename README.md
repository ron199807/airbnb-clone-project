2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions are welcome! Please open an issue first to discuss what you'd like to change.


## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
1. **Intuitive Navigation**: Users should easily find and book properties
2. **Visual Hierarchy**: Important elements (price, booking button) should stand out
3. **Responsive Design**: Seamless experience across all device sizes
4. **Trust Indicators**: Build confidence with reviews, host info, and clear policies
5. **Minimal Friction**: Streamline the booking process with minimal steps

### Key Features to Implement
- Interactive property search with filters
- Image gallery with smooth transitions
- Clear pricing breakdown
- Instant booking availability calendar
- Saved favorites/wishlist functionality
- Responsive navigation menu

### Primary Pages Overview

| Page | Description | Key Components |
|------|------------|----------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Main search results page displaying available properties | - Search filters <br> - Property cards with images <br> - Map view toggle <br> - Pagination controls |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Detailed view of a single property | - Image gallery <br> - Amenities list <br> - Booking widget <br> - Host profile <br> - Reviews section |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Streamlined booking process | - Date selection calendar <br> - Price summary <br> - Payment form <br> - Booking confirmation |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design in Booking Systems
A well-designed booking system directly impacts conversion rates and user satisfaction:
1. **Reduces Abandonment**: Complex flows lead to dropped bookings
2. **Builds Trust**: Clear information architecture establishes credibility
3. **Enhances Accessibility**: Simple designs work for all user types
4. **Improves Efficiency**: Users complete tasks faster with intuitive layouts
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Critical as >50% of bookings happen on mobile



### Figma Design Specifications

**Color Styles:**
- `Primary`: #FF5A5F (Used for main actions and important elements)
- `Secondary`: #008489 (Used for secondary actions and highlights)
- `Background`: #FFFFFF (Main background color)
- `Text`: #222222 (Primary text color)
- `Secondary Text`: #717171 (For less important text)

**Typography:**
- **Primary Font**: 
  - Family: Circular
  - Weight: Medium (500)
  - Size: 16px (base size for most text)
- **Headings**:
  - Family: Circular
  - Weight: Bold (700)
  - Sizes: 24px-32px (depending on heading level)
- **Secondary Text**:
  - Family: Circular
  - Weight: Book (400)
  - Size: 14px

### Importance of Identifying Design Properties
Documenting design specifications from mockups is crucial because:

1. **Consistency**: Ensures uniform styling across all components and pages
2. **Developer Handoff**: Provides exact values for implementation
3. **Design System**: Forms the foundation for scalable UI development
4. **Brand Identity**: Maintains visual coherence with the original design
5. **Efficiency**: Reduces guesswork and back-and-forth between designers and developers
6. **Accessibility**: Helps maintain proper contrast ratios and readable typography

## UI Component Patterns

### Core Reusable Components

#### 1. Navbar
**Purpose:** Global navigation and search functionality  
**Structure:**
- **Logo**: Clickable Airbnb-branded logo (links to homepage)
- **Search Bar**: Interactive search with location/date filters

- Sticky positioning (remains visible on scroll)
- Dynamic background (transparent â†’ solid on scroll)
- Mobile-optimized touch targets

#### 2. Property Card
**Purpose:** Display property preview in listings  
**Structure:
- **Property Image**: Hero image with hover zoom effect
- **Basic Details**:
  - Price (with dynamic formatting)
  - Location (truncated intelligently)
  - Rating (star-based with count)
- **Favorite Button**: Heart icon with persistence

### Implementation Principles
1. **Atomic Design**:
   - Build from small atoms (buttons) to complex organisms (cards)
   
2. **Props-based Customization**:
   ```jsx
   <PropertyCard 
     title="Beachfront Villa" 
     price={120} 
     rating={4.92} 
     isFavorite={false}
   />
